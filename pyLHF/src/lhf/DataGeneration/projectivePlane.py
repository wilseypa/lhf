def real_projective_plane(numPoints = 20000, trials = 8, selection = 'min'):
    '''
    There is an embedding of RP2 in R4 defined by sampling points from a sphere and mapping (x, y, z) 
    # to (xy, xz, y^2 âˆ’ z^2, 2yz). This embedding is defined in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane. 
    # However, this sampling is not guaranteed to be uniform.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numPoints: int 
        The number of points desired in the output point cloud (default 20000)
    trials: int 
        The number of trials used to optimize the distribution of points in the dSphere (default: 8)
    selection: str (min, mean, var)
        The selection criteria to select between two candidate point clouds:
            'min' : maximize the minimum nearest neighbor distance of the points
            'mean' : maximize the mean of the nearest neighbor distances.
            'stdev' : minimize the standard deviation of the nearest neighbors

    Returns
    -------
    plane: the point cloud
